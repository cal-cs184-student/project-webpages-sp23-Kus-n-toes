    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
</a>
<blockquote><b>
    Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
    To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.
    You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
    <br />
    <small>
        Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>?
        A high <code>ks</code>?
    </small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>Changing the spring constant creates changes in how the mesh wireframe “bounces” as it falls in the simulation, and
    the differences are most clearly shown when we look at the normals as the cloth falls. With a ks of 100 N/m, the
    cloth has many micro bounces and ripples as it falls, created by the lack of corrective spring forces occurring as
    each point mass gets displaced under the force of gravity, allowing for the overall topology of the cloth to become
    deformed, only being constrained by our heuristic.. Comparatively, a ks of 100000 leads to a very smooth fall in the
    cloth, as the massive spring corrective forces keep the cloth relatively stable as it falls, each point mass is
    binded to the springs surrounding it more so than being deformed by gravitational force.
</p>


<blockquote><b>
    <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
    </small>
</b></blockquote>


<p>A similar, but inverse effect happens as we change density, with a higher density (&rho; = 1000 g/cm^2) causing more ripples
    while a &rho; of 1 causes a smooth, gradual fall. As our cloth doesn’t change in volume throughout our different
    simulation runs, changing density directly changes the mass of the cloth itself. As our external force, gravity, is
    proportional to mass (as per Newton’s second law), the higher density, the more effect gravity has onto the cloth in
    comparison to the spring forces. Thus, it makes sense that a extremely low mass would result in a smooth fall, as
    our spring forces would dominate the movement of each point mass, and vice versa for a cloth of large mass.
</p>

<blockquote><b>
    <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
    </small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    Damping has the most obvious visual effect on the cloth. As damping is an important factor in Verlet integration,
    increasing the damping to 50% has a direct effect on how much each point mass moves per timestep, creating the
    illusion of slowing down (if damping is increased) or speeding up the simulation. Along with that, decreasing the
    damping to around 10% results in the cloth swinging beyond its rest state as it falls and ripples in the simulation,
    which makes sense as damping is supposed to simulate the loss of energy, but here the cloth acts akin to a pendulum,
    swinging until friction (or the damping term in this case) forces it to rest.
</p>



<blockquote><b>
    <small>
        For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters
        and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

<blockquote><b>
    <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    With ks=50, the cloth holds less tension and more willingly sags to mold to the shape of the sphere. It also creases more easily, kind of like silk or some soft stretchy material.
    With ks=5000, the creases are larger and it spreads more outwards from the sphere. This is because the cloth is held more tightly to itself, and thus spreads out around the top point while the outer points are weighed by gravity but pulled up by the spring forces.
    With ks=50000, the spring forces are strongest and the cloth is less willing to fold around the sphere. Instead it creases in a few places, but the creases are large and rounded. The normal force of the sphere combined with the spring forces of the cloth result in some flaps extending outwards horizontally, resisting gravity.

<p>
    In low density, the cloth acts lighter and creases more gently and in more spaced out intervals. As density increases, the cloth crumples more and folds more easily, resulting in smaller and less spread out folds.
    With low ks, the cloth resists folds less and crumples more easily. It piles into a smaller, crinkly shape with rough and frequent folds. As ks increases, the folds become more spread out and take up more space, resulting in more air pockets. The cloth maintains its shape better, folding into a squiggly pile.

<blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
    A shader program accelerates the process of creating realistic lighting, similar to how raytracing renders scenes. Instead of simulating and tracing light rays,
    shaders pipeline geometries through vertex and fragment files. The vertex shaders calculate and provide positional and other various information at the vertices, which
    are then interpolated across the faces using barycentric interpolation. This information is passed to the fragment shaders, which are analagous to pixel samplers.
    They take the interpolated values from the vertex shaders and generate a color using various approaches.
</p>


<blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
</b></blockquote>


<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model calculates the total amount of light the vertex reflects to the camera from a single
    point light as the sum of the ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting. The ambient lighting represents any
    scattering of light rays that end up reflecting off our vertex and into the camera. The diffuse reflection term
    takes in the distance the light is away from our vertex as its falloff and determines the amount of light reflected
    based off of Lambert’s cosine law. Finally, the specular reflection term uses the bisecting vector between the
    incoming and outgoing rays to determine how strong the specular reflection will be, the closer that vector is to
    the surface normal, the stronger the illumination.
